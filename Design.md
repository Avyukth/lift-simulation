# Lift Simulation: Conceptual Guide for API and Deployment

## 1. Core API Endpoints

### 1.1 System Configuration

- Configure System: POST endpoint to set up the number of floors and lifts
- Retrieve Configuration: GET endpoint to fetch current system configuration

### 1.2 Lift Operations

- List Lifts: GET endpoint to retrieve all lifts and their current states
- Move Lift: POST endpoint to move a specific lift to a target floor

### 1.3 Floor Operations

- Call Lift: POST endpoint to request a lift to a specific floor

### 1.4 Real-time Updates (# WIP)

- WebSocket Connection: Endpoint for real-time updates on lift movements and status changes

## 2. Core Functionality Concepts (# WIP)

### 2.1 Lift Movement Logic

- Implement a basic algorithm for assigning the nearest available lift to a floor call
- Manage lift movements between floors, including status updates
- Simulate realistic lift movement timing

### 2.2 Real-time Updates

- Use WebSocket to broadcast lift movements and status changes to connected clients
- Ensure efficient message formatting for real-time communication

### 2.3 Concurrency Handling

- Implement appropriate concurrency control mechanisms for managing simultaneous lift operations
- Consider using locks or optimistic concurrency control methods

## 3. Deployment Strategy

### 3.1 Containerization with Docker

- Create a Dockerfile to define the application environment
- Include all necessary dependencies and configurations
- Build and push the Docker image to a container registry

### 3.2 Orchestration with Kubernetes (# WIP)

- Create Kubernetes Deployment configuration:
  - Specify the number of replicas
  - Define container specifications including image and port
  - Set up environment variables for configuration
- Create Kubernetes Service configuration:
  - Define how to expose the application (e.g., LoadBalancer type)
  - Specify port mappings

### 3.3 Deployment Process (# WIP)

1. Apply Kubernetes configurations using kubectl
2. Verify the deployment status
3. Implement scaling strategies as needed

### 3.4 Monitoring and Logging (# WIP)

- Utilize Kubernetes built-in monitoring tools
- Implement application logging to stdout/stderr for easy collection by Kubernetes

## 4. Testing Strategies (# WIP)

### 4.1 API Testing

- Use API testing tools to verify endpoint functionality
- Test various scenarios including edge cases

### 4.2 Load Testing

- Implement load tests to simulate multiple concurrent users
- Verify system performance under expected and peak loads

## 5. Future Enhancements

1. Advanced Lift Scheduling: Implement more sophisticated algorithms for lift assignment and movement
2. Security: Add authentication and authorization to API endpoints
3. Persistence: Implement persistent storage for system state and historical data
4. CI/CD: Set up automated pipelines for testing and deployment
5. Analytics: Develop features for system performance analysis and optimization

This conceptual guide provides an overview of the key components and considerations for implementing the Lift Simulation system. It covers the essential API design, core functionality concepts, deployment strategy, testing approaches, and potential future enhancements. Use this as a high-level roadmap for developing and deploying your Lift Simulation application.
